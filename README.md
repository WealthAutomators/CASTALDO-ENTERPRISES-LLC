# SAI HOLDING LLC

A production-quality ecommerce storefront built with Next.js App Router, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

SAI HOLDING LLC — *Smart Choices. Better Living.* — is a general online marketplace selling electronics, home essentials, beauty, toys, pet supplies, sports gear, and more. Brand assets, colors, copy, and product data are data-driven, so the storefront can be re-themed without rewriting components.

- **Next.js 15** (App Router)
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS v4**
- **shadcn/ui** (Radix primitives)
- **Lucide Icons**
- **Framer Motion** (subtle animations)
- **Embla Carousel**
- **React Context** (cart, wishlist, recently viewed)
- **localStorage** persistence (no backend)

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

```bash
npm run build   # Production build
npm run start   # Start production server
```
